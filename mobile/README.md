# RPP Auto Mobile

✅ **BUILD FIX APPLIED (2026-01-22)**

Removed invalid `google-services.json` file that was causing Android build failures.

The app now uses Supabase for backend services instead of Firebase.

## Current Status
- ✅ Invalid google-services.json removed
- ✅ App configured for Supabase backend
- 🔄 Testing new build...

## Build History
- **Before Fix**: Android builds failing due to invalid Firebase configuration
- **After Fix**: Builds should complete successfully
